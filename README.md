### Project Overview

This project involves creating an automation framework in Java using Cucumber and Selenium WebDriver to test the search functionality of the Amazon Website. The framework is designed to cover various search scenarios.

### Objectives

- Automate the testing of search functionality to ensure reliability and efficiency.
- Create a reusable and scalable automation framework.
- Integrate the framework with Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD) and Selenium WebDriver for web automation.
- Produce detailed reports of test executions.

### Technologies Used

- **Java**: Programming language for writing test scripts.
- **Cucumber**: BDD framework to write test cases in a human-readable format.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Tool for automating web application testing.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework for running tests.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for managing project dependencies.

- ### Components

1. **Feature Files**
   - Contains Cucumber feature file written in Gherkin language, defining the test scenarios.

2. **Step Definitions**
   - Contains Cucumber step definition that map to the steps in feature files.

3. **Page Objects**
   - Contains classe representing web page of the application.Class includes web elements and actions performed on those elements.

### Test Reports

The framework generates detailed HTML reports after test execution, which can be found in the `target` directory.
